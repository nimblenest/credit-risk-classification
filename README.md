# credit-risk-classification

Overview of the Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in predicting loan status based on historical lending data. The dataset contains information about loan applicants, including features such as credit score, income, employment length, and loan amount. The goal is to build and assess the performance of different machine learning models to predict whether a loan applicant will default or not.

Results:

-Accuracy Score: 0.99

-Precision Score: 0.85

-Recall Score: 0.99

-F1-Score: 0.92

Summary:

The logistic regression model achieved a high accuracy score of 0.99, indicating that it correctly classified 99% of the loan applicants. The precision score of 0.85 suggests that out of all the predicted defaults, 85% were actual defaults. The recall score of 0.99 indicates that the model identified 99% of the actual defaults. The F1-score, which combines precision and recall, is 0.92. This demonstrates a good balance between precision and recall.

Overall, the logistic regression model performed well in predicting loan defaults based on the provided features. Its high accuracy, precision, and recall scores indicate its effectiveness in identifying default cases. Therefore, I recommend using this model for predicting loan status in future lending decisions. However, further validation and testing may be required to ensure its accuracy across different datasets and scenarios.
